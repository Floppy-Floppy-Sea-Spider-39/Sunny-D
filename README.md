# Overview

Upon logging in, users are greeted with their current local weather conditions, showing temperature, current conditions, and UV index. Users are able to click on the large button in the center of the screen when they go outside, which triggers the D-Meter to fill up with Sunlyte in real time! We've calulated the recommended daily dose of vitamin D and UV exposure so that the meter fills up at different speeds based on the user's local conditions.

And if the user wants to view their achievements, simply switch to the next tab to keep track of your goals, and to see if you're staying up to par with the recommended daily dose!
